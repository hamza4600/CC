## CS  50 Algorithm 
    string :
        an array  of charactre,
        array is a Block of memeory contiguisly store Data

Desigh of Code :
    How efficent a code is when it grow in Size  ,  How much time and  How Much steps does It Take to complete .


# Measuring The Space and Time complexity of Algo

depend upon of Input (n) 
# Linear ALogo will always have N number of steps

in Best case It will be 1  and worst Case It will be n 
have to complet These Steps fro completion    

# Logithm in ALgo
 evert Time we are working with The alogo That Divide half and Half we will use log n .
  In C string are the array The Aray Of Caharacter 

# C 
    in c we can also Creat our own Data Type according to our Requiremnet we wanted as float , bool , array 
    typedef struct 
    typedef is a Keyword to Craet A Data Type 
    struct  tells compiler That  this a Data Type Having few Dimensions 
    C is not a Object Orinatatin Langauge 
    Now we Have a ABilty to do any Thing In A pROGARAMMING  Language we wanted  creat our own Data Types 
    chrom

# Most of time we Generally compare Alogos 

# Selection Sort in O(n2)
    we go Back word and forward and  place small Item at first 
    best case also remain same 
# Bubble  Sort in O(n2)
    we compare Pairs and shift their positions 
    best case Cenerio of bubble sort is O(n)  : if all items are sorted

# Recursion : 
    function call itself in-itself  

# Merge Sort :
    left half , and Right Half ,
    sort both of them and then sort The final  sort and Merge 
    O(log n) : space time complexity

Why DSA 
 used in all Langues used to write efficent Program I By usinG Basix Data Stucture
Algorithm Is  an way to solve program and Get Get Desire Outcome from a prgram 
we write Optimized Program In Computer 
 can write any Kinde of Progam

  Data Structure is a Key Componenet Progarmming used to writte OS and Software

  Most Of Them are Insipre from Real World 
  we can Handell Multiple Data requestes and Data Handeleing In Optimixed Way 

`  Two main Types 
  PRIMATIVE 
  NON PRIMITIVE types` 

  PRIMATIVE    
    Can Hold single Value in the int cahr , bool,
    NoN PRIMATIVE  
        are of Two types 
        LINEAR 
        NON LINEAR  STRCUTURE 

LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE 
    they include IN LInear way and One element is connect to another element in a way   
    ARRAY
    SATCK
    QUEUE
    LINKED LIST 

NON LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE 
   THey are connected with more than ONE  elements are randomaly arrange  
    TREE 
    GRAPHS


STATIC    
    : AT  compile time size ia allocated , Max size is fixed 
DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURE 
    : at run time sixe is allocated   sixe is flexible 


    common opertions 
    SEARCHING
    SORTING    
    INSERTION
    UPDATION
    DELETION


    ALGORITHMS 
    STEPS TO GET REQUIRED OUTPUT 
    it should have wel defined outputs and Valued Output 
    should be terminated  after completion
    Must Have few steps and Directions
    alogoritms sholud be writen in Human LANGUAGE AND cAAN bE CODEDE in desire Language   to implete it we can use and Programming Language



    C is mother of all Lamguages and OS compiler are written in It   can understand How sysytems Arcitecture workes   
    
    Foundational for All Languages
    Low level  for  writting Compillers and Engine writtng

    Faster than all 
    best fro performance 

 CONCEPT OF TIME COMPLEXITY AND BIG O NOTATION
 tO CALCULATE HO EFFICENT A  ALGORITHM IS 

 O(n)   mean to measure complexity of a algorithm 
  n :  means how much operation an algorithm takes to complete the steps 

O(n)  means it depend upon the number n means if n increase the complexity also incease depend upon on the size

O(n2)   it is worst case  very slow   mean if n=10 it will  take 100 operation to calculate the Task   

O(1) : is best case   means constant time 

supose we have an array each indivisual is the same size in array we take that sixe and Multiply with the index of the element ans we get the required data 

One of good example of O(1) is a hash Table 
In whic we pass Data with key  value and to get Data we pass Key to function and get  Output 
They are very efficenty for inserting Data and reteriving Data   It have fixed Time .
Now we wil Take an example on an Array we have an array with integer have memeoru address and of 4 bytes 
 if we want to get an element we will pass the memory sixe of  Item and then mutiply with the Number of  item in array and we get the address of item we wanted 



O(log n) : it is also Good 
 worst case O(n!)  is the most worst case 
O(2)   :  it is also the worst case 

       
LineAR algorithm it take entire list lenght  : it is worst case seniro

Binaary search Algorithm :
    it will always starts from the middle . we have to make array in sorted array .
    we check out the Data if is less the the them more towared the Other side 
    we cut down the Data and Hera come the concept of log(n) : 


Worst alogorithm :
    Like a nested Loop,  for every element we have to check all elemsnt in an array . where we have to place in array , 
    It will have O(n2) .

O(n!) : 
    n is the Input size  
    we can say by  increaseing of n by One Number add computation Grow Alots .
    like 3!=6 and 4!=24.
    we don,t have enought compution power to calculate .
    


    BASIC OF OBJECT ORINTATION  LANGUAGE 

Classes and Objct :
    Data structure Store data.
    Class is a Blue Print that define Varibles and The Methods to all Common to that Object of a certin Kind 
    class is a user defined descripltion what a certin Object will look Like we can define Varibles and function in It 

    we can also say it is lika container in whicj we have define Methods and Varibles 
    Methods : are functions do processing 

Inheritence :
    core concept of Object orintation Programming . It is a mechanism wher we can to derive a  class from another class for a hieraracy of classes that sgare a set of attributes of classes that share a set of attributes and methods

    Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class        

Polmorphism : 
    Means have many forms . In simple world we can define it as  a abaality of a message to be displayed in more than one form . 
    Or we can also say that use of a single symbol to represent mutiple different types
    Describle something occure in several differnt forms        

Encapsulation :
    it refer to the building that data with the  methods that operates on that  Data > It is used to hide the Value of a State of a Structred Data object inside a class , Prevent unathorized parties diret access to them 
    The general idea of this mechanism is simple. For example, you have an attribute that is not visible from the outside of an object. You bundle it with methods that provide read or write access. Encapsulation allows you to hide specific information and control access to the internal state of the object.

    Setting and Getting are  the Important examples of  it


    ARRAY And LINK LIST :
    to store large data and perform differn opertions on it   

    TWO MAIN TYPES OF ARRAY :
    STATIC ARRAY :
        Static arrays have their size or length determined when the array is created and/or allocated. For this reason, they may also be referred to as fixed-length arrays or fixed arrays.

        in a computer Memeory all Data is store in sequentaly so 
    DYNAMIC ARRAY : 
        Dynamic arrays are those arrays which are allocated memory at the run time with the help of heap.Thus Dynamic array can change its size during run time. 



LINK LIST :
     a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.


     WE CAN ALSO SAY THAT it is series of data structure which are connected nodes .
     each node store Data and address of next node .
     It have head and Tail .
     start and end  at end we have Null . 
     there ane Differnt Types Single , Double , Circule ,

     Two amin parts Data Item and Adddres of next node that can be any wher in memory 
     The power of a linked list comes from the ability to break the chain and rejoin i
     creat a new structur and allocate memory to it 
     add dat value as 4
     Point it next structe node contain 2 as the Data Value .

     doin somthing Like this inan aray we have to shift tyhe Poisition of all element 
     explainHow Pointers Works .
     explaun TRESS and GRAPHS

     Time complexity :
     SEARCH : O(n);
     INSERT : O(1);
     DELETION: O(1);

     SPACE COMPLEXITY ;
        O(n);

     Featurs :
      Dunamic Memory Allocation,
      implementing StacK and Queue,
      Hash Table and Graphs ,

       commmom exmaple od Link List is Our Browswer History that we go to New Link and Go baxck Is Saved
